- `simulation.py`: Simulating an on-off across step modulation's influence to the detected range profile.
- `tag_localize.py`: Localization of tag.
- `config_profiling.py`: Runtime profile of radar initialization.
- `multiple_measures.py`: Leveraging multiple frames that starts at different frequencies to generate a large step array for longer ranges.
