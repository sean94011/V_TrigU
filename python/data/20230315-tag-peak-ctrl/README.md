# Experiment Descriptions
- Experiment 1: CAL: tag is powered & CTL = 0, DATA: tag modulating at 125us switching rate (10 steps).
- Experiment 2: CAL: tag is powered & CTL = 0, DATA: CTL = 1
- Experiment 3: CAL: tag is not powered, DATA: tag modulating at 125us
- Experiment 4: CAL: 5 min after tag is powered, CTL = 0; DATA: tag modulating at 125us
- Experiment 5: CAL: none; DATA: tag modulating at 125us
- Experiment 6: CAL: tag powered, CTL = 0; DATA: tag modulating at 1 second (~10 frames)
- Experiment 7: CAL: none; DATA: tag modulating at 1s (~10 frames)
- Experiment 8: CAL: tag off; DATA: tag off with CR along tag
